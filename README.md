#Kit Sandbox

The Kit Sandbox is a default file and template structure for rapid prototyping of websites. Kit is used in the Wireframing and UI process to easily build template files while maintaining the ability to include variables and other dynamic content.

##What's Inside
-	Foundation 4
-	"Modular" SASS/SCSS
-	jQuery

##How to Use

The Kit Sanbox already contains a <code>codekit.json</code> file, so all you have to do to get started is drop the project in. Keep in mind this is just a standard starting point for rapid prototyping and it is only a basic set up. Expand upon it, grow it, make it better, then share it. (It really isn't anything special!)
